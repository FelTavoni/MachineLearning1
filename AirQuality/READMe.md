## 🔍 About

The following program intends to predict air quality based on the amount of carbon monoxide. This problem purpose by professor Diego Furtado in the discipline of Machine Learning aims to solve a known problem using linear regression methods. In sequence, we'll analyze some approaches to tackle this problem by predicting the quantity of carbon dioxide in the air.

In this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality), you can locate the dataset that was used. We also made a jupyter notebook available with the same text below for a better comprehension around the topic.


## 💻 Predictive Models

### 🗿 Multiple Linear Regression

With linear regression, we were able to predict ...

By analyzing seaborn correlations, it's possible to observe that carbon monoxide has a strong correlation compared to ozone, nitrite dioxide, and NHMC. As that said, we'll use only those attributes when creating or multiple linear regression model.

## ⚙️ In production

- [ ] Build the predictive model to predict the amount of CO2 relying on air
  - [ ] Analyze the data obtained in UCI
  - [ ] Write a better *Multiple Linear Regression* section
- [ ] Remove NaN from dataset
